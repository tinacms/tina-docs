## 📖 How to Use TinaDocs

There are two ways you can use TinaDocs:

• **For developers** – as a launching point to develops a highly custom docs solution. TinaCMS is based on markdown. Use this code as a basis to [implement custom components](https://tina.io/docs/reference/types/rendering-markdown#linking-to-react-components) to be used in MDX to fit your use case. Follow the Getting Started guide below.

• **Quickest experience** – use as is and deploy in minutes via TinaCloud for a docs setup that you still hold all the keys and data for, and get to using right away.


> 💡 TinaCMS integrates tighly with GitHub, and has a powerful [editorial workflow](https://tina.io/docs/tina-cloud/editorial-workflow) based on GitHub's branch protection features.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

> 💡 We recommend `pnpm` for faster installs. [Learn why pnpm is great](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/best-package-manager-for-node/) for Node.js projects.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### **Step 2: Start Development Server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your docs in action.

## 🌐 Production Setup

### **Step 3: Set Up GitHub and TinaCloud**

1. **Add your docs to GitHub**: Push your local repository to GitHub if you haven't already
2. **Create a TinaCloud account**: Sign up at [app.tina.io](https://app.tina.io)
3. **Link your repository**: Connect your GitHub repository to TinaCloud through the dashboard
Note: if you don’t see your repo in the list, click the button “Configure your TinaCloud permissions on GitHub” at the bottom of the page

### **Step 4: Configure Environment**

1. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your Tina credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_CLIENT_ID=<get this from app.tina.io>
TINA_TOKEN=<get this from app.tina.io>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TINA_BRANCH=<your content branch>
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_SELECTION=<dispaly theme selector>
```

**Theme Preview Mode:**
To enable a theme selector in the UI for previewing all themes, add:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_THEME_SELECTION=true
```

> 💡 **Note:** The theme selector allows you to preview different themes in real-time, but these changes are temporary and won't persist when you open a new browser window/tab. To make a theme permanent, update the `Selected Them` field in your Settings through TinaCMS.

### **Step 5: Build for Production**

```bash
pnpm build
```
