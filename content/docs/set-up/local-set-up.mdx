**Note**: We recommend these steps for creating a new project when heavy customization is necessary.

To quickly set up a new Tina starter, use the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
npx create-tina-app@latest
```

When prompted, select the "tinadocs" starter. This will scaffold a new project with TinaCMS configured for documentation sites.

### Running the Starter

1. Move into the project directory:

```bash
   cd <your-starter-name>
```

1. Run the project using pnpm:

```bash
   pnpm run dev
```

This will start a local development server, allowing you to preview your site.

Installation and other setup is included in the `npx` command.

### Additional Information

The TinaDocs stack...

* **Next.js**: The starter uses Next.js, a popular React framework for building fast web applications. Learn more about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
* **pnpm**: We use pnpm for package management, which is faster and more efficient than npm. Learn more about [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).
* **Biome**: For code formatting and linting, we use Biome. Learn more about [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/).

For a visual guide, check out the video tutorial on the [TinaCMS documentation site](https://tina.io/docs/introduction/using-starter).

### Next Steps

Continue through this section to [set up TinaCloud](/docs/set-up/setting-up-tinacloud) and [deploy your docs site](/docs/set-up/deploying-your-docs).

If you're not ready to deploy just yet, jump over to the section on [editing content](/docs/customising/editing-content) and start updating your content locally.
