Now our site is up and running, let's start using the **no-code editing window**.

We've set up **visual editing** in this starter so you can view changes on your page live.

## Running your Project

The TinaCMS editor has two modes:

1. **Local Development Mode**: When running your site locally for development
2. **Production Mode**: When using the deployed version of your site

In local development mode, changes are saved directly to files in your local repository. In production mode (with TinaCloud), changes are committed directly to your Git repository.

## Accessing the Editor

The TinaCMS editor is available at the `/admin` route of your site.

Here's how to access the editor in different environments:

* **Local Development**:
  * Run `pnpm run dev` in your terminal
  * Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin`
  * Changes are saved to your local files
* **Production**:
  * Visit `https://<DOMAIN>/admin`on your deployed site
  * If you are hosting your site with TinaCloud you will be asked to log in
  * If you self-host you will be prompted to plug in your own authentication credentials

Once on this route, you will see a pencil icon in the top left hand side of the screen. Click to open it.

## The Initial Editing Interface

Once the editor is open you will be prompted with numerous fields representing the content on this page. The layout of these fields is dictated by the schema of this collection.

Here we can make edits to the content of our file and witness the changes in real time (WYSIWYG)

## Editing Other Files

Whilst we can navigate through our files with the admin route prefixed, we can also use the editor to edit other files. 

You'll notice on the top left of the open editor there is a menu button (indicated by the three lines icon).

Clicking it will open another slide-out showing your Collections. You can think of each collection as a  structured data type (or different table in your database). 

Out of the box, all files on the docs route will be stored in your docs collection. If you click on the Docscollection you will see all of your other files in this project in a file directory structure. Navigate through and find the file you want to edit.

## The Editing Interface

> **Visual Editing**: TinaCMS offers a powerful visual editing experience where you can see your changes in real-time. This works alongside the standard document editor and provides a WYSIWYG approach to content editing. Toggle between form mode and visual mode to get the best of both worlds.

The TinaCMS editing interface consists of several key components:

1. **Collections Navigation**: The sidebar lists all your content collections (blog posts, pages, etc.) – basically each one has a unique data definition. This is useful to distinguish between different page structures in your project.
2. **Document List**: Displays all documents within a selected collection
3. **Document Editor**: The form for editing a specific document
4. **Media Manager**: For uploading and managing media files

### Making and Saving Changes

1. Select a collection from the sidebar
2. Choose a document to edit
3. Make your desired changes in the form
4. Click "Save" to commit your changes

When working locally, changes are saved directly to your local file system. When using TinaCloud, changes are committed to your GitHub repository.

### Understanding Tina's Data Management

TinaCMS takes a unique approach to content management:

#### Git-Based Content Storage

Unlike traditional CMSs with databases, TinaCMS stores all your content as files in your GitHub repository:

* **Markdown (.md)**: For simple content
* **MDX (.mdx)**: For Markdown with JSX components
* **JSON (.json)**: For structured data
* **YAML front matter**: For document metadata

For example, this documentation page is stored as an MDX file with YAML front matter:

```mdx

### How Changes Are Saved

When you save changes in TinaCMS:

1. **Local Development**: Changes are written directly to your local file system
2. **Production with TinaCloud**: Changes are committed to your Git repository through the following process:
   * The change is sent to TinaCloud and indexed
   * TinaCloud creates a commit in your repository
   * Your site is rebuilt with the new content

For collaborative workflows, TinaCloud can be configured to create pull requests instead of direct commits, allowing for content review.

### Advanced Editing Features

TinaCMS includes several advanced features to enhance your editing experience:

* **Visual Editing**: Edit content directly on your site with side-by-side preview
* **Rich Text Editor**: Format text with a WYSIWYG editor
* **Media Management**: Upload and manage images and other media files
* **References**: Create relationships between different content types
* **Custom Fields**: Create specialized editing components for specific content types

### Next Steps

Once you're familiar with the basic editing interface, you might want to:

1. Customize your content schema
2. Set up visual editing
3. Create custom field components
4. Configure advanced validation
