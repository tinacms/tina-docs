> These instructions assume you've already deployed your site – if you created it with the TinaCloud QuickStart, this has all been done for you.

Let's get to grips with the **no-code editing workflow** in production.

## First Steps…

1. You'll need a GitHub account, if you don't have one – create one and come back.
2. Add your account to the project in TinaCloud (or ask your admins to add you).

## Making Edits

1. Go to the [/admin](/admin#/~/docs/tinadocs-and-tinacms/editing-content) route of your website
2. Change the content in one of the fields and watch your site preview update in real time. This is called **visual editing**.
3. Press save.

    This will automatically trigger an update to your site, unless you have [editorial workflow](https://tina.io/editorial-workflow) features enabled (giving teams a Git based approval workflow).
  </>}

> **Note:** these kinds of updates shouldn't create any downtime, depending on your deployment pipeline.

## Editing a Specific Page

### Collections Menu

You can either look through all your pages via the **collections menu**, or turn on edit mode for a specific page.

To go to the collections menu, go to your [/admin](/admin) route, then open the sidebar and follow the below graphic.

Clicking on any of the above documents will take you to the visual editor for that page.

### By URL

Alternatively, you can access the editor for a page you're on by updating the url.

Between the **domain** and **the path** of the page you want to edit, add `/admin/#/~/` to take you to the live editor for that page.![](</Untitled design (10).png> "Going to the edit route on a particular URL")

## Adding a New Page

To create a new doc, go to the Docs collection and click “Add File”.

Folders can be organised as you see fit, and this file path controls the url of that document.

> For example, a document, `A.mdx` in the folder `/B` can be accessed at `DOMAIN/docs/B/A`.

    All documents will be exposed, regardless of whether they're included in the navigation bar or not.

## Managing the Navigation Bar

To edit the navigation bar on the left hand side of your screen, you will need to go into a different collection - called Navigation Bar

![](/img/navigation-collection-example.png "Navigation Bar Collection Example")

Out of the box you will see a series of pre-created 'groups', this is how you will be able to split up all the content in your documentation site.

To create a new empty group click on the blue plus button. With your new group created click into it to modify its name and content.

By clicking the plus icon in this group, you can now choose to add a document item to the collection or another level of nesting by creating a sub-group.

Choosing item will create an undefined item, to modify it click into it.

Now you can choose the name that this document will have in the navigation bar and the specific file you want this navigation item to render in the Page value.

Click save and you have now made added, edited and inserted your new document into your site 🎉

### Next Steps

Once you're familiar with the basic editing interface, you might want to:

1. Customize your content schema
2. Set up visual editing
3. Create custom field components
4. Configure advanced validation
