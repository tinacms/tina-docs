## Running your Project

The TinaCMS editor has two modes:

1. **Local Development Mode**: When running your site locally for development
2. **Production Mode**: When using the deployed version of your site

In local development mode, changes are saved directly to files in your local repository. In production mode (with TinaCloud), changes are committed directly to your Git repository.

## Accessing the Editor

The TinaCMS editor is available at the `/admin` route of your site.

Here's how to access the editor in different environments:

* **Local Development**:
  * Run `pnpm run dev` in your terminal
  * Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin`
  * Changes are saved to your local files
