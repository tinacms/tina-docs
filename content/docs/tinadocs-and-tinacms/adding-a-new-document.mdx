Now that you know how to edit existing documents, what if we want to add a new document?

This tutorial will guide you through how the navigation system works on TinaDocs and how you can start adding your own documents.

## Adding Documentation

To start adding new pages go to your Docs collection in the Tina Editor and click Add Files in the top right hand corner of the screen.

<Callout
  body={<>
    The file path your new document is stored in does not impact it's position in the navigation bar. It will only set the path the file is actually rendered on!
  </>}
  variant="info"
/>

Now with your new document page you can fill in the respective content and click save, but how will users be able to find this page?

This is where our flexible navigation bar solution comes in.

### Editing the Navigation Bar

To edit the navigation bar on the left hand side of your screen, you will need to go into a different collection - called Navigation Bar

![](/img/navigation-collection-example.png "Navigation Bar Collection Example")

Out of the box you will see a series of pre-created 'groups', this is how you will be able to split up all the content in your documentation site.

To create a new empty group click on the blue plus button. With your new group created click into it to modify its name and content. 

By clicking the plus icon in this group, you can now choose to add a document item to the collection or another level of nesting by creating a sub-group. 

Choosing item will create an undefined item, to modify it click into it. 

Now you can choose the name that this document will have in the navigation bar and the specific file you want this navigation item to render in the Page value.

Click save and you have now made added, edited and inserted your new document into your site ðŸŽ‰
