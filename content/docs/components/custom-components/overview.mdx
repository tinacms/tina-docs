TinaDocs supports extending your Markdown with custom React components, allowing you to render interactive or styled elements inline with rich text contentâ€”similar to MDX.

This makes your documentation not just static text, but a fully dynamic UI.

TinaDocs comes with a few standard MDX components, but there is full extensibility to add your own.

## How They Work

To create custom components to be used in your markdown you need to first create a template of the component, defining the structure of its data. To find out more about template schemas, refer to the [Template Documentation](https://tina.io/docs/reference/templates).

```typescript
export const CalloutTemplate = {
  name: "Callout",
  label: "Callout",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "body",
      label: "Body",
      type: "rich-text",
      isBody: true,
    },
    {
      name: "variant",
      label: "Variant",
      type: "string",
      options: ["warning", "info", "success", "error", "idea", "lock", "api"],
      defaultValue: "warning",
    },
  ],
};
```

Then in our docsCollection template we must define the components template inside of it. 

```typescript
import type { Template } from "tinacms";

export const docsCollection = {
  name: "docs",
  label: "docs",
  path: "content/docs",
  format: "mdx",
  fields: [
    //Rest of fields
    templates: [
      calloutTemplate as Template // [!code focus]
    ]
  ]
}
```

Now with ouryourschema set-up, you can use the embed + button in your rich-text editor to input the component and start filling in its data.

To define how the component is rendered you must map it in your TinaMarkdown object components = MarkdownComponentMapping
