TinaDocs supports extending your Markdown with custom React components, allowing you to render interactive or styled elements inline with rich text content—similar to MDX.

This makes your documentation not just static text, but a fully dynamic UI.

TinaDocs comes with a few standard MDX components, but there is full extensibility to add your own.

## How They Work

To create custom components to be used in your markdown you need to first create a template of the component, defining the structure of its data. To find out more about template schemas, refer to the [Template Documentation](https://tina.io/docs/reference/templates).

```typescript
export const CalloutTemplate = {
  name: "Callout",
  label: "Callout",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "body",
      label: "Body",
      type: "rich-text",
      isBody: true,
    },
    {
      name: "variant",
      label: "Variant",
      type: "string",
      options: ["warning", "info", "success", "error", "idea", "lock", "api"],
      defaultValue: "warning",
    },
  ],
};
```

Then in our docsCollection template we must define the components template inside of it. 

```typescript
import type { Template } from "tinacms";

export const docsCollection = {
  name: "docs",
  label: "docs",
  path: "content/docs",
  format: "mdx",
  fields: [
    //Rest of fields
    templates: [
      calloutTemplate as Template // [!code focus]
    ]
  ]
}
```

Now with ouryourschema set-up, you can use the embed + button in your rich-text editor to input the component and start filling in its data.

To define how the component is rendered you must map it in your TinaMarkdown object components = MarkdownComponentMapping
