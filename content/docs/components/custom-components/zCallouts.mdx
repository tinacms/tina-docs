Callouts are visually distinct content blocks used to highlight important informationâ€”such as tips, warnings, notes, or best practices.

There are 7 types of callouts in TinaDocs: "warning", "info", "success", "error", "idea", "lock", "api"

<Callout

    We can warn users about specific features
  </>}

/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Talk about successful responses or tutorial actions
  </>}
  variant="success"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Or even talk about specific technical components
  </>}
