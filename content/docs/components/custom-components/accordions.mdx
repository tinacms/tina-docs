TinaDocs supports custom components like accordions, allowing you to embed collapsible content areas inside your Markdown or block-based documentation. This is ideal for FAQs, advanced explanations, or progressive disclosure UI patterns.

## Accordion Blocks

You can block all of your accordions with the option to have them as full-width or half-width.

<accordionBlock
  fullWidth={true}
  accordionItems={[
    {
      heading: "Click to expand",
      docText: "Default Text. Edit me!\n",
      image: "/img/rico-replacement.jpg"
    },
    {
      heading: "Click to expand",
      docText: "Default Text. Edit me!\n",
      image: "/img/rico-replacement.jpg"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Individual Accordions

<accordion
  heading="Click to expand"
  docText={<>
    Default Text. Edit me!
  </>}
  image="/img/rico-replacement.jpg"
  fullWidth={false}
/>
