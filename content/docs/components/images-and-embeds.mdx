Add images and HTML embeds through the rich-text toolbar.

## Images

Adding visual content to your site has never been easier - to do so click on the picture icon in the toolbar and you'll be able to upload, select, and pick from images in your repositories media library

## Embeds

We also support a series of embeds so you can insert video formatted content in a more optimized way. 

Got ideas for any other embeds you want to see? Let us know on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf)

### YouTube Embeds

To embed a YouTube video in your documentation site, click on the three dots in your tool-bar, click 'Embed' and select YouTube video.

You can click into these embed objects to modify their fields (i.e Video URL, Captions etc)
