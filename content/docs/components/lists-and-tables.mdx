Lists in TinaDocs are created using standard Markdown syntax and can be styled or extended using Tailwind and React overrides.

TinaDocs also supports basic markdown tables, which are ideal for presenting simple data like features. They can be added by clicking the three dots in the rich-text toolbar and clicking the table icon.

Lists can be directly inserted from the rich-text toolbar using the bulleted or numbered lists buttons or automatically in the body by using "\*", "-" and "1."

## Lists

We can order our lists:

1. First Item
2. Second Item
3. Third Item

Our keep them unordered:

* First Item
* Second Item
* Third Item

## Customizing Lists

You can override the lists rendering using the components prop in the \<TinaMarkdown/> function.

```javascript
<TinaMarkdown
  content={content}
  components={{
    ul: (props) => <ul className="ml-5 list-disc text-blue-700" {...props} />,
    li: (props) => <li className="mb-2" {...props}/>,
  }}
```

## Tables

Tables have an interesting markdown syntax which can be confusing to some, it looks like such:

```
| Feature    | Free Plan | Pro Plan |
| -----------| ----------| ---------|
| Hosting    | ✓         | ✓        |
| API Access | ✗         | ✓        |
| Support    | Email     | Priority |
```

However, TinaCMS' extension of PlateJS allows users to skip the funky styling and use the table feature in the rich-text editor.
