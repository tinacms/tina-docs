## Components

TinaCMS is a bare-bones tool with no pre-built page elements.

TinaDocs brings a number of key page elements (components) needed for comprehensive documentation, especially for software projects.

They can all be modified or extended upon.

> Some of these components were built in React and used as .mdx components.
