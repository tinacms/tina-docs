TinaDocs supports both inline code snippets and fenced code blocks, letting you document examples, commands, and source code with clarity and flexibility.

## Inline Code

Using a singular backtick we can wrap small bits of code as a code\_block

Example: Use `npm run dev` to start the local server

## Fenced Code Blocks

For multiline code samples, use triple backticks. Where we can also specify which language is used in the fenced code block.

```javascript
js function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

## Syntax Highlighting

TinaDocs uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) to power code block rendering, because of this you are able to also use [Shiki's Transformer Notation](https://shiki.style/guide/transformers) for special highlighting.

```javascript
console.log('This is a highlighted block') // [!code highlight]

It uses "[!code highlight]" in a comment after the code
```

## Diff Highlighting

```javascript
console.log('This is a negative diff') // [!code --]
console.log('This is a positive diff') // [!code ++]

It uses "[!code --]" or "[!code ++]" in a comment after the code
```

## Focused Highlighting

```javascript
console.log('Junk Code');
console.log('Focused Code'); // [!code focus]
console.log('More hidden code');

It uses "[!code focus]" in a comment after the code
```
