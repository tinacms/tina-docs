TinaDocs provides a suite of customizable components that power your developer documentation with editable content, consistent styling, and extendable logic.

All of these components were built in React and are used as .mdx components. They can also be modified or extended upon.

## The Technical Side of Component Rendering

All content written in the body of your documentation is stored as the rich-text data-type.

This data-type is broken down into a hierarchical abstract syntax tree (AST). This data can be parsed into the \<TinaMarkdown> object such like:

```javascript
import MarkdownComponentMapping from "@/markdown-component-mapping";

<TinaMarkdown
  content={documentionData?.body}
  components={MarkdownComponentMapping} // [\!code highlight]
/>
```

Where the MarkdownComponentMaping unction parses each object from the AST data into their corresponding React components based on node type, allowing you to override default rendering behavior for elements like headings, links, code blocks, and more.

Such like:

```javascript
import { TinaMarkdown } from 'tinacms/dist/rich-text'

export const CustomMarkdown = ({ content }) => {
  return (
    <TinaMarkdown
      content={content}
      components={{
        h2: (props) => <h2 className="text-2xl text-blue-600" {...props} />,
        a: (props) => <a className="underline text-red-500" {...props} />,
        code_block: (props) => <pre className="bg-black text-white p-2">{props.children}</pre>,
      }}
    />
  )
}

```
