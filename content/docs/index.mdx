Just deploy and start writing.

TinaDocs is an open source documentation solution built off TinaCMS.

Built for both developers and non-developers.

> No proprietary data store, your content lives entirely in your GitHub repository—versioned, portable, and fully under your control.

## 🧹 Start Fresh (Optional)

Want to start with a clean slate? This template includes example documentation that you can remove with a single command:

```bash
pnpm run cleanup
```

**🚨 IMPORTANT WARNING:** 
 
**This command will PERMANENTLY DELETE all documentation content and only keep this index page.**
 
- ❌ **If you've already made changes**, running cleanup will DELETE your work
- ✅ **Run cleanup FIRST** if you want a clean slate, then make your changes
- ✅ **Explore examples FIRST** if you want to learn TinaDocs features before deciding
 
**This action cannot be undone unless you have committed your changes to git.**
