> Since TinaCMS has no proprietary data store, your content lives entirely in your GitHub repository—versioned, portable, and fully under your control.

## What is TinaCMS?

TinaCMS is a Git-backed CMS for developers. It lets you build a custom editing UI using React, with content stored in markdown or JSON and committed straight to Git. No database, no admin panel—just full control and instant versioning.

For more details, check out our documentation. If you have further questions, feel free to join our community on Discord.

## About the Starter Docs Package

This starter is a ready-to-use documentation site powered by TinaCMS. It includes:

* A minimal, clean UI with file-based routing.
* Markdown content stored in your Git repo.
* Live editing via Tina’s sidebar interface.
* Pre-built components for code blocks, callouts, and navigation, and more.
* Git-based version control out of the box.

It’s ideal for teams who want a fast, customizable way to build and maintain developer docs without sacrificing flexibility or control.
