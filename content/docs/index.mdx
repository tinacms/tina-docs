Just deploy and start writing.

TinaDocs is an open source documentation solution built off TinaCMS.

Built for both developers and non-developers.

> No proprietary data store, your content lives entirely in your GitHub repository—versioned, portable, and fully under your control.

## 🧹 Start Fresh (Optional)

Want to start with a clean slate? This template includes example documentation that you can remove with a single command:

```bash
pnpm run cleanup
```

⚠️ Warning: This will delete all documentation and only keep this index page. You can always explore the examples first, then run the cleanup when you're ready to add your own content.
