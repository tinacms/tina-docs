## Tips to create the perfect Work Item

Here are some tips to creating the perfect work item!

## 1. State your intent

Begin the recording with the purpose.

> “Send an email task to...”\\

> “I have a new feature request for SugarLearning...”

## 2. Detail bug reports

For bugs, mention reproduction steps and expected behaviour.

> “First do this, then do this, then this error occurs, but I expect it to do this”

Note: Have a look at [Tip #1 - Draft your bug with enough details](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/report-bugs-and-suggestions/#tip-1-draft-your-bug-with-enough-details)

## 3. Mention additional team members

So you include others who are not in the meeting.

> “...Cc Adam and Uly”

Note: Creating a PBI or bug report will automatically CC the Product Owner and Tech Lead. [why?](https://yakshaver.ai/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions)

## 4. Move PBIs

If the PBI was created in the wrong project, use the “Move PBI” option to relocate it to another project.

## 5. Collaborative effort goes a long way

Invite a colleague when recording to allow for multiple perspectives and explanations, allowing for increased clarity and quality of the work item.
