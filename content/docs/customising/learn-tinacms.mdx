Now that you've set up your TinaDocs site, you might want to gain a deeper understanding of how TinaCMS works. TinaCMS is a powerful, flexible headless CMS that allows you to build custom editing experiences for your content.

### Understanding the Basics

TinaCMS is more than just a content management system – it's a toolkit for building your own custom CMS experience. Some key concepts to understand:

* **Git-backed content**: Your content lives in your Git repository as Markdown, MDX, or JSON files
* **Visual editing**: Edit your content directly on your website with live preview
* **Content modeling**: Define your content structure using a schema
* **GraphQL API**: Query your content using a powerful GraphQL API

### The TinaCMS Beginner Series

The [TinaCMS Beginner Series](https://tina.io/docs/beginner-tutorials/tutorial-overview) is an excellent resource for learning TinaCMS from the ground up. This series of tutorials guides you through building a project step-by-step, helping you understand how all the pieces fit together.

The series includes four modules:

1. **Installing TinaCMS** and rendering content from the CMS
2. **Implementing Visual Editing** for live, side-by-side content editing
3. **Creating content models** to structure your data
4. **Using blocks** to create a modular website builder

Following this series will give you a comprehensive understanding of TinaCMS's capabilities and how to leverage them in your own projects.
