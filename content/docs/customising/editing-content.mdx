Now our site is up and running, let's start using the **no-code editing window**.

We've set up **visual editing** in this starter so you can view changes on your page live.

## Running your Project

The TinaCMS editor has two modes:

1. **Local Development Mode**: When running your site locally for development
2. **Production Mode**: When using the deployed version of your site

In local development mode, changes are saved directly to files in your local repository. In production mode (with TinaCloud), changes are committed directly to your Git repository.

## Accessing the Editor

The TinaCMS editor is available at the `/admin/index.html` route of your site.

Here's how to access the editor in different environments:

* **Local Development**:
  * Run `pnpm run dev` in your terminal
  * Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`
  * Changes are saved to your local files
* **TinaCloud Production**:
  * Visit `https://<DOMAIN>/admin/index.html` on your deployed site
  * Changes are automatically pushed to your Git repository
* **TinaCloud Local Preview**:
  * Run `pnpm run build` followed by `pnpm run start`
  * Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/index.html`
  * This lets you test the production editor locally

### The Editing Interface

> **Visual Editing**: TinaCMS offers a powerful visual editing experience where you can see your changes in real-time. This works alongside the standard document editor and provides a WYSIWYG approach to content editing. Toggle between form mode and visual mode to get the best of both worlds.

The TinaCMS editing interface consists of several key components:

1. **Collections Navigation**: The sidebar lists all your content collections (blog posts, pages, etc.) – basically each one has a unique data definition. This is useful to distinguish between different page structures in your project.
2. **Document List**: Displays all documents within a selected collection
3. **Document Editor**: The form for editing a specific document
4. **Media Manager**: For uploading and managing media files

### Making and Saving Changes

1. Select a collection from the sidebar
2. Choose a document to edit
3. Make your desired changes in the form
4. Click "Save" to commit your changes

When working locally, changes are saved directly to your local file system. When using TinaCloud, changes are committed to your GitHub repository.

### Understanding Tina's Data Management

TinaCMS takes a unique approach to content management:

#### Git-Based Content Storage

Unlike traditional CMSs with databases, TinaCMS stores all your content as files in your GitHub repository:

* **Markdown (.md)**: For simple content
* **MDX (.mdx)**: For Markdown with JSX components
* **JSON (.json)**: For structured data
* **YAML front matter**: For document metadata

For example, this documentation page is stored as an MDX file with YAML front matter:

```mdx

#### Collections and Content Modeling

In Tina, content is organized into collections. Each collection is defined in your `tina/config.js` file and specifies:

1. **Name**: The identifier for the collection
2. **Path**: Where files are stored in your repository
3. **Format**: File format (md, mdx, json, etc.)
4. **Schema**: The structure of your content (fields, validation, UI components)

```javascript
// Example collection definition
{
  name: 'page',
  path: 'content/pages',
  format: 'mdx',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: 'body',
      type: 'rich-text',
      isBody: true,
    }
  ]
}
```

#### How Changes Are Saved

When you save changes in TinaCMS:

1. **Local Development**: Changes are written directly to your local file system
2. **TinaCloud**: Changes are committed to your Git repository through the following process:
   * The change is sent to TinaCloud
   * TinaCloud creates a commit in your repository
   * Your site is rebuilt with the new content

For collaborative workflows, TinaCloud can be configured to create pull requests instead of direct commits, allowing for content review.

### Advanced Editing Features

TinaCMS includes several advanced features to enhance your editing experience:

* **Visual Editing**: Edit content directly on your site with side-by-side preview
* **Rich Text Editor**: Format text with a WYSIWYG editor
* **Media Management**: Upload and manage images and other media files
* **References**: Create relationships between different content types
* **Custom Fields**: Create specialized editing components for specific content types

### Next Steps

Once you're familiar with the basic editing interface, you might want to:

1. Customize your content schema
2. Set up visual editing
3. Create custom field components
4. Configure advanced validation
