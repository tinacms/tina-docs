TinaDocs supports documenting your API directly from an OpenAPI .json specification (OAS). This allows you to generate structured, editable documentation blocks that reflect real API endpointsâ€”without manually copying and pasting details.

## How to Add API Documentation

1. When in the admin route, open the editor and navigate in to the API Schema collection
2. For each new OAS spec, create a new file, name it accordingly and navigate into it
3. Drop your OAS into this file, it will and click save
4. Now in any of your document files, click embed and add the API Reference component
5. Inside of this component you will now be able to select which OAS and which specific endpoint you want to render

> We are currently in the works of building automatically rendered pages for API consisting of numerous references instead of for each specific endpoint
