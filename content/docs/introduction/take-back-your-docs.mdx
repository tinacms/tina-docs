Most documentation builder platforms lock you into certain style patterns and rigid workflows that limit customization. **This starter package changes that.**

As an open source project with a headless CMS, it gives you full control over both your content and your UI—no templates you can’t tweak or structures you’re stuck with.

## Built-in Themes

With 6 bespoke themes and an elegant design system, docs are a pleasure to read and write.

Built with React and Next.js, extend as needed with code.

## What is TinaCMS?

[TinaCMS](https://tina.io) is a Headless Git-backed CMS for developers.

It lets you build a custom editing UI using React, with content stored in markdown or JSON and committed straight to Git. No database, no admin panel—just full control and instant versioning.

## About the Starter Docs Package

This starter is a ready-to-use documentation site powered by TinaCMS. It includes:

* A minimal, clean UI with file-based routing.
* Markdown content stored in your Git repo.
* Live editing via Tina’s sidebar interface.
* Pre-built components for code blocks, callouts, and navigation, and more.
