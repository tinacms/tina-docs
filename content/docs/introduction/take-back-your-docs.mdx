Most documentation builder platforms lock you into certain style patterns and rigid workflows that limit customization. **This starter package changes that.**

Built with **TinaCMS**, it gives you full control over both your content and your UI—no more templates you can’t tweak or structures you’re stuck with.

> Since TinaCMS has no proprietary data store, your content lives entirely in your GitHub repository—versioned, portable, and fully under your control.

## What is TinaCMS?

[TinaCMS](https://tina.io) is a Headless Git-backed CMS for developers.

It lets you build a custom editing UI using React, with content stored in markdown or JSON and committed straight to Git. No database, no admin panel—just full control and instant versioning.

For more details, check out our [documentation](https://tina.io/docs). If you have further questions, feel free to join our community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zumN63Ybpf).

## About the Starter Docs Package

This starter is a ready-to-use documentation site powered by TinaCMS. It includes:

* A minimal, clean UI with file-based routing.
* Markdown content stored in your Git repo.
* Live editing via Tina’s sidebar interface.
* Pre-built components for code blocks, callouts, and navigation, and more.
* Git-based version control out of the box.

It’s ideal for teams who want a **fast**, **customizable** way to build and maintain developer docs **without sacrificing flexibility or control**.
