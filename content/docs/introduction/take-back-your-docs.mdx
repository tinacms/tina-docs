Most documentation kits lock you into certain style patterns and rigid workflows. **This starter package changes that.**

As an open source project using a headless CMS, it gives you full control over both your content and your UI—no templates you can’t tweak or structures you’re stuck with.

## Built-in Themes

With 6 bespoke themes and an elegant design system, docs are a pleasure to read and write.
