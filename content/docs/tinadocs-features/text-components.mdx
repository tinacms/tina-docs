Multiple embedded components – accordions, callouts, cards, and preloaded images are available out of the box.

<Callout
  body={<>
    We can embed non-standard features into our markdown with the power of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
  </>}
  variant="idea"
/>

## Using Embedded Components

You can see and add an Embed from the rich-text editor toolbar.

<preloadedImage
  image={{
    src: "/img/docs-assets/embed-toolbar-access.png",
    width: 1675,
    height: 674,
    alt: ""
  }}
  caption="Access the embed tab of the toolbar."
/>

## Cards

Cards can be used to showcase information or as links.

They highlight on hover based on the theme.

<cardGrid
  cards={[
    {
      title: "Pine",
      description: "Linked card.",
      link: "https://www.google.com",
      linkText: "Search now"
    },
    {
      title: "Indigo",
      description: "This card doesn't link anywhere.",
      link: "",
      linkText: ""
    },
    { title: "Blossom", description: "🌸", link: "", linkText: "" },
    { title: "Lake", description: "🏞️", link: "", linkText: "Search now" }
  ]}
/>

## Accordions

Collapsible content areas.

This is ideal for FAQs, advanced explanations, or progressive disclosure UI patterns.

### Multi-accordion

You can block all of your accordions with the option to have them as full-width or half-width.

<accordionBlock
  fullWidth={true}
  accordionItems={[
    {
      heading: "Click to expand",
      docText: "Default Text. Edit me!\n",
      image: {
        src: "/img/rico-replacement.jpg",
        width: 1408,
        height: 768,
        alt: ""
      }
    },
    {
      heading: "Click to expand",
      docText: "Default Text. Edit me!\n",
      image: {
        src: "/img/rico-replacement.jpg",
        width: 1408,
        height: 768,
        alt: ""
      }
    }
  ]}
/>

### Individual Accordion

Accordions can also exist standalone.

<accordion
  heading="Click to expand"
  docText={<>
    Default Text. Edit me!
  </>}
  image={{
    src: "/img/rico-replacement.jpg",
    width: 1408,
    height: 768,
    alt: ""
  }}
  fullWidth={true}
/>

## Callouts

Callouts are similar to block-quotes, to add a note or indication outside the normal content flow.

<Callout
  body={<>
    Multiple variants exist to convey different messaging.
  </>}
  variant="success"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Some callouts indicate potential issues to users.
  </>}
  variant="warning"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Some callouts indicate existing issues, or negative examples.
  </>}
  variant="error"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Some are just for a note or tip.
  </>}
  variant="idea"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    Security related callouts exist too 👮.
  </>}
  variant="lock"
/>

<Callout
  body={<>
    …or some other specific options!
  </>}
  variant="api"
/>

## Preloaded Images

Preloaded images are optimized image components that prevent layout shift by storing dimensions with the image. This improves Core Web Vitals and provides a better user experience.

### Why Use Preloaded Images?

Regular markdown images (`![alt](path)`) load dimensions at runtime, which can cause:
- Layout shift as the page loads (poor CLS score)
- Slower initial render
- Flickering content

Preloaded images solve this by:
- ✅ Storing width and height with the image
- ✅ Preventing layout shift (better CLS)
- ✅ Showing a loading skeleton while loading
- ✅ Smooth fade-in transition when loaded
- ✅ Built-in lightbox support

### Regular Markdown Image vs Preloaded Image

**Regular markdown image** (loads dimensions at runtime):

<preloadedImage
  image={{
    src: "/img/docs-assets/embed-toolbar-access.png",
    width: 1675,
    height: 674,
    alt: ""
  }}
  caption="Regular markdown image - loads dimensions at runtime"
/>

**Preloaded image** (dimensions stored, no layout shift):

<preloadedImage
  image={{
    src: "/img/docs-assets/embed-toolbar-access.png",
    width: 1920,
    height: 1080,
    alt: "Preloaded image with dimensions"
  }}
  caption="Preloaded image - dimensions stored, smooth loading"
/>

### Loading States

Both image types show a loading skeleton while the image loads:
- Regular images: Load skeleton + fetch dimensions
- Preloaded images: Load skeleton only (dimensions already known)

### When to Use Each Type

**Use regular markdown images** when:
- Quick documentation or notes
- Image optimization is not critical
- You don't mind runtime dimension loading

**Use preloaded images** when:
- Page performance matters (Core Web Vitals)
- Professional documentation
- Preventing layout shift is important
- You want consistent loading experience

### Adding Preloaded Images

You can add preloaded images from the rich-text editor toolbar's embed menu.
