TinaDocs includes features to auto-generate docs pages based on an OpenAPI spec.

You can also choose to use the same components to create API pages manually.

## Upload a Specification

There's a unique collection for storing OpenAPI specifications, and they can be managed independently.

## Using Specification Data

You can read from the specification inline via the API Reference component or generate sections of the nav-bar based on available routes.

### Inline

Select a schema from the dropdown, and all routes will be shown – you can further select a singular route to be used for the component.

  }}

### Page Generation

You can generate entire directories to match your spec – marked and colour coded based on route.

1. Create a Tab with the “API Tab” Template.
2. Create a Supermenu Group with the “Group of API References” Template.
3. Choose the spec to be used, and check endpoints to be included.
4. Press save for generation.

    If you have any “Group of API References” with checked options in the Navbar settings, saving will regenerate the documents.
