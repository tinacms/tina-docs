TinaDocs gives you full control over your site‚Äôs redirects, which you can configure directly through the TinaCMS interface.

## üöÄ Built-in Redirects Support

TinaDocs is built on top of \*\*Next.js\*\*, which supports static and dynamic redirects through the \`next.config.js\` file located at the root of your project.

This allows for seamless integration of redirect rules during the build process, ensuring that your routes behave as expected across environments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Your Redirects

To update or add your redirects using the TinaCMS admin interface, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the \`/admin\` route of your site.
2. In the sidebar, click on **Settings**.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page.
4. Look for the **Redirects** section.
5. Click **+ Add New** to create a new redirect, or click an existing one to modify it.

Each redirect entry typically includes:

* **Source Path** (from)
* **Destination Path** (to)
* **Permanent** (boolean flag for 301 vs 302)
* **Conditions** (optional advanced rules)

## üìù Example

Here's what a redirect entry might look like in \`next.config.js\` if manually defined:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return \[
      {
        source: '/old-route',
        destination: '/new-route',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```
