A favicon is the small icon that appears in your browser tab, bookmarks, and on mobile home screens. TinaDocs supports custom favicons so you can brand your documentation site to match your product.

## Change to Match your Logo

1. Open the codebase of your new site
2. Navigate to the public/ directory 
3. Delete the existing favicon.ico
4. Insert your own logo image into the public/ directory 
5. Rename it to favicon.xxx
