TinaDocs gives you full control over how your documentation looks and feels. Whether you're aligning with a brand, switching between dark/light modes, or styling markdown elements, everything is customizable with Tailwind CSS, theme variables, and custom component overrides.

## For Non-Developers

There are a series of customization options for those who don't want to get wrangled in a codebase.

TinaDocs currently supports 2 themes which will control the look and feel of your documentation site.

* Default: A TinaCMS inspired theme, which can be seen used on the [TinaCMS Documentation](https://tina.io/docs)
* Monochrome: The standard basic look and feel of documentation sites with heavy emphasis on black and white colour palettes.

When first starting your TinaDocs project via npx create-tina-app\@latest or via the [TinaCloud Quickstart](https://app.tina.io/quickstart) you will be prompted to which theme you would like to use.

If you wish to change this, it's super simple. Navigate to your .env file within the codebase and modify the NEXT\_PUBLIC\_TINA\_THEME value.

## For Developers

The bulk of the styling in this project is done with TailwindCSS version 4.0+, all the custom design libraries and theming can be found labelled in the styles/global.css file and configured to your needs.
